## About the Project

I sometimes play Pixelmon to relax, but when I needed Pokémon information, I had to search through many different websites and pages.

Instead of opening hundreds of tabs, I wanted to see everything in one place.  
That is why I started building this Pokédex desktop application.

I have been working on this project for about **7–8 months**, and I believe the result was worth the effort.
